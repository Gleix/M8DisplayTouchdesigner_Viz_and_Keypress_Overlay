# M8 Display + simple visual features

See video overview for info: https://youtu.be/FMR5dIHkMnY

Built on top of the original .toe file provided by Dirtywave (0183dcf / Dec 24, 2021). Two additional files in the 'M8DisplayTouchdesigner' folder: 

### M8Display_GleixViz.toe - Adds a few additional UI elements for controlling: 

- Full view // Full device is shown, buttons light up when pressed
- Audio // Settings for routing audio from the M8 via USB
- RGB Sliders // Controls color of the buttons & some visual scenes
- RGBA Sliders // Control the color & transparency of the background (for use with spout output / OBS)
- Particles // Particles emit from buttons when pressed
- CRT TV emulation
- 8 preset visual scenes, some of which are color controllable, one of which accepts MIDI sync & transport
- Touchscreen/mouse support (click on buttons of the m8 in full view)
- Poorly (re: not) optimized, may not run well on some systems 

### M8Display_GleixViz_LightweightKeypressOverlay.toe - Lightweight, no visuals, meant for use as an overlay 

- RGB(a) Sliders // Control button color, background color & alpha (keying or output via syphon spout)
- Audio // Settings for routing audio from the M8 via USB
- Touchscreen/mouse support (click on buttons of the m8 in full view)
- Particles // Same as above. Particle container isn't cooking when not in use and shouldn't take up any resources. 
- Syphon Spout still functional, great for using as a source directly into OBS (may need to install Spout plugin for OBS - https://offworld.live/spout-plugin-for-obs-studio)

Installation & connection instructions same as original below.
